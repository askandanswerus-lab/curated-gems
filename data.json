    "summary_en": "This study explores the limitations of large language models (LLMs) in performing reasoning tasks when information is encoded in various ciphers. The researchers fine-tuned and few-shot prompted models from Qwen 2.5 and GPT-4.1 families using math reasoning problems encoded in simple ciphers like base64, rot13, and others. Surprisingly, they found that LLMs only showed performance improvements for very simple ciphers, with no uplift for intermediate-difficulty ciphers they could translate back to English. This suggests that LLMs struggle with reasoning in encodings uncommon in their pretraining data. The research has important implications for understanding LLM capabilities, particularly in relation to cipher-based jailbreaks and the nature of their reasoning processes. It challenges the assumption that translation abilities equate to reasoning capabilities and highlights that current LLMs likely rely heavily on human-understandable content for their reasoning.",
    "summary_zh": "该研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在处理密码编码信息时的推理能力限制。研究人员对Qwen 2.5和GPT-4.1系列模型进行了微调和少样本提示，使用base64、rot13等简单密码编码的数学推理问题。令人惊讶的是，他们发现LLMs仅在非常简单的密码中表现出性能提升，而在中等难度的密码中无法提升，即使它们能将密码解码回英语。这表明LLMs在预训练数据中不常见的编码中难以进行推理。该研究对理解LLMs能力具有重要意义，特别是关于基于密码的越狱和它们的推理过程本质。它挑战了翻译能力等同于推理能力的假设，并强调当前LLMs在推理中可能高度依赖人类可理解的内容。",

The author, Jess Cartner-Morley, argues that with the right styling—such as straight cuts, tailored fits, and strategic accessories like blazers and leather belts—jeans can exude sophistication suitable for both office settings and fine dining. The piece highlights the importance of fabric rigidity, proper fit, and intentional layering to create a polished look. It also touches on the psychological aspect of fashion, suggesting that the juxtaposition of denim with structured garments can radiate confidence. The article concludes by advocating for jeans as a smart, easy choice for any occasion, even referencing Julia Roberts' red carpet appearance to underscore its point.",
